				<div class="read" id="content1">
					<input type="checkbox" id="expand1">
					<p>By 2030, companies will transform how they power the economy, move people and goods across the globe, source materials and design products and services. Through these actions, companies will reduce absolute GHG emissions across their value chains by at least 50% in order to limit warming to 1.5 ºC, or less, over pre-industrial levels. In order to limit warming to 1.5 ºC companies will also remove carbon emissions, within and outside their value chains, on a trajectory to net-zero emissions by 2040. Recognizing the human impacts of the climate crisis, companies will prioritize strategies, solutions and public policies that support a just and equitable transition to a net-zero emissions economy. To meet this vision by 2030, companies will take the following actions:</p>

				<div class="read" id="content2">
					<input type="checkbox" id="expand2">
					<p>By 2030, companies will decouple business growth from the destruction of natural ecosystems and commit to becoming resource positive, giving back more than they take from the planet, in a way that strengthens ecosystems and prioritizes resource access for vulnerable communities. Companies will design waste and pollution out of their businesses, keep products and materials in use and protect and restore natural ecosystems and biodiversity. In particular, companies will recognize fresh water as the world’s most precious natural resource, essential to whole industries and all communities and ecosystems. By sustainably managing water use, eliminating pollution, taking collective action and supporting the human right to water, companies will achieve a water balance in high stress regions, on the trajectory to net positive water impact. To meet this vision by 2030, companies will take the following actions:</p>

				<div id="content3" class="read">
					<input type="checkbox" id="expand3">
					<p>By 2030, companies will demonstrate through policies, goals and management systems an understanding of how these can contribute to a more just and equitable society. They will start with a respect for the fundamental human rights of their direct and indirect workforce and those people impacted directly and indirectly by corporate activities—and they will become strong advocates for changing the institutions and policies that perpetuate inequities. Companies will recognize the value of an equitable, diverse and inclusive workplace and provide all employees with equitable treatment, opportunity, wages and benefits—recognizing the particular need to empower and invest in women and other historically disadvantaged and underrepresented groups throughout its value chain. Corporate workforces at all levels, including the board and senior leadership, will reflect the intersectional diversity (gender, race, sexual orientation, disability, etc.) of the company’s stakeholders. In an economy increasingly marked by rapid transformation, companies will actively consider the human impact of business model disruption and will work to support a just and inclusive transition for all impacted employees, consumers and communities. To meet this vision by 2030, companies will take the following actions:</p>
